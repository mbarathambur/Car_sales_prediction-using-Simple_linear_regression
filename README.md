Project Overview:

This project focuses on predicting car sales prices using Simple Linear Regression. The notebook performs data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to understand how different factors influence car prices.


Workflow:

->Import Libraries – pandas, sklearn

->Data Loading – Read the dataset using pandas

->Data Splitting – Separate dependent (Price) and independent (Year) variables

->Train-Test Split – Split the data into training and testing sets

->Model Training – Use LinearRegression from scikit-learn

->Model Evaluation – Calculate evaluation metrics 

->Model Serialization- pickle

Results:

The Linear Regression model effectively captures the relationship between features and car prices, offering insights into sales patterns based on year.
